Some dumbass game about a broke ass main character stuck at the bottom of society and constantly in debt. It's also collaboration project for a game design class at school. 

The game has no setting but if it had to have one, it would probably the hood. The character profile pics in the game were all supposed to be placeholders, but we were too lazy too replace them. We decided Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow battle music was appropriate for the battles and we probably would have beheaded by Nintendo copyright ninjas if this game wasn't for education.

Most of the games developement was cleaning up messes that we created by trying to cleaning up other messes. Occasionaly we would add a new feature, which subsequently created another mess and so on. Despite everything the end result was pretty great.
